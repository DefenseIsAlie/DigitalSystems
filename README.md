# Understanding VHDL and Implementing 3-bit full adder / subtracter, ALU, 4:2 priority encoder in VHDL

# Aim:
To implement 3-bit full adder, 3-bit full subtracter, ALU, 4:2 priority encoder
using VHDL code and run the code on CPLD board.

# Summary of the Experiment:
1. VHDL code for 3-bit adder/subtractor in structural modelling style. The adder/subtractor operation is controlled by signal ’m’.
2. VHDL code for ALU which performs (0,1,2,3) -> (+,-,bitwise and, bitwise xor) operation depending on selection lines
3. VHDL code for 4:2 priority encodes with active high enable pin
